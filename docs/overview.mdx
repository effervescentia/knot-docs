# Overview

The Knot Language is made up of a number of different layers.

## [Modules](syntax/module)

Modules are the largest constructs in Knot, they can contain multiple [declarations](syntax/declaration) such as
[functions](syntax/declaration/function) and [views](syntax/declaration/view). Modules can [import and export](syntax/module/import-export) entities
so that code stored in a different modules can be accessed and reused.
Modules are referred to using a name that is based on their path from the source directory of your project.

## [Declarations](syntax/declaration)

Entities can only be declared within a module (functions can technically be created anonymously within a closure by using lambda expressions).
Each type of entity is used to define an independent, re-usable piece of an application.

## [Statements](syntax/statement)

The `let` bindings are only available to define variables within a closure, such as a function body.

## [Expressions](syntax/expression)

As a functional language, Knot was designed to make as much of the language usable as an expression so it can be easily composed.
These include simple primitives like [booleans](syntax/primitive/boolean) and [integers](syntax/primitive/number#integer) as well as
binary operations, unary operations, closures and more!

## [Primitives](syntax/primitive)

The most basic types you can use to describe data in your application. These include `nil`, `boolean`, `integer`, `float`, `string` and `element`.
