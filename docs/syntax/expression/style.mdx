# Styles

Styles can be used to decorate [elements](../element) which in turn influences how they are rendered.
In a browser environment this is equivalent to styling elements using CSS.

## Definition

```knot
const emptyStyle = style { };
```

## Style Rules

Styling rules are defined as key-value pairs. The value of each rule has implicit access to
the `Style` module through variables prefixed with `$`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="knot" label="Knot">

```knot
style {
  color: $red,
  height: $px(100),
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="css" label="CSS">

```css
{
  color: red;
  height: 100px;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Raw Style Rules

It is ultimately the goal of this project to have complete covergage for writing style rules in
idiomatic knot syntax, but CSS is complex! While our platform-specific styling libraries are
growing it will sometimes be easiest to express styles with raw values.
All style rule values can be optionally provided as raw strings.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="knot" label="Knot">

```knot
style {
  color: "rgba(1, 23, 139)",
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="css" label="CSS">

```css
{
  color: rgba(1, 23, 139);
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
