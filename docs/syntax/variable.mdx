# Variables

Reference data by storing it in a variable; it's the way of the future!

:::info
Variables in Knot are immutable except for within the scope of state entities (coming soon!).
:::

## [Constants](declaration/constant)

Constants are statically declared within a module and can be referenced within that module or outside
of it by way of an [import](module/import-export).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="knot" label="Knot">

```knot
const MY_CONST = "my const";
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tsx" label="TypeScript">

```tsx
const MY_CONST = "my const";
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## [Let Bindings](statement/let-binding)

Variables can be declared within any closure (such as in a [view](declaration/view) or a [func](declaration/function))
and referenced by other expressions within the same closure.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="knot" label="Knot">

```knot
func closureExample(value: integer) -> {
  let result = value + 6;

  result;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tsx" label="TypeScript">

```tsx
function closureExample(value: number) {
  let result = value + 6;

  return result;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
