# Modules

Modules represent the largest shareable and reusable code element.
They can be imported from other files in your project.

## Structure

Modules are read from top to bottom and nothing can be referenced before it has been declared.
This also means that functions cannot be recursively called (for now). There is also a recommended order for entities to appear in modules.
However, it should be noted that modules with many different entities should often be split into multiple modules to better separate concerns.

- [`import` statements](import-export)
- [`const` declarations](../declaration/constant)
- [`func` declarations](../declaration/function)
- [`view` declarations](../declaration/view)
