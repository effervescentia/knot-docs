# Let Bindings

You can use the `let` keyword to bind a value to some name so it can be referenced withing a closure.

:::info
Variables in Knot are immutable except for within the scope of state entities (coming soon!).
:::

## Scope-Local

Since these bindings are local to a closure they can be re-used in different scopes without conflict.
